## choice 5 was this until, through some critical thinking I was able to fix it:
## where = input("\nWhich attribute would you like to check?:\t")
##         if where in attributes:
##             print (attributes.get(where))
##         else:
##             print ("\nThe attribute you picked doesn't exist. Check the \n\
##                choices available to see attributes")
##            
##            
##

Welcome to the greatest intellectual challenge of all time: Tic-Tac-Toe.
This will be a showdown between your human brain and my silicon processor.

You will make your move known by entering a number, 0 - 8. The number
will correspond to the board position as illustrated:


\t\t0 | 1 | 2
\t\t---------
\t\t3 | 4 | 5
\t\t---------
\t\t6 | 7 | 8

Prepare yourself, human. The ultimate battle is about to begin. \n

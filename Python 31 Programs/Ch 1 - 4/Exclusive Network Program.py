##Exclusive Network Program

##Set variable (security) outside while loop

##Set other variable (username) outside loop

username = ""
## "not" operator makes the value opposite of what it is
##Eg. var username is currently false - because of empty string \
## not username means username = "" is actually True not False

##Set variable password outside of following while loop
password = ""
while not password:

##If else statements to complete the while loops and set the \
## database for all available users
